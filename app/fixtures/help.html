    <p>Your privacy is very important and the app will not collect any data which 
      is not absolutely necessary for its functionality.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The COVID-19 Tester</strong> is collecting the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>DeviceId</strong> - this is an identifier which is persistent accross successive 
        usage of the app and will change once the mobile app is deleted. Since it's
        changing every time the app is deleted and reinstalled, it cannot be used
        to uniquely identify you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location</strong> - the location is used upon your consent to share it only to 
        detrmine the country, region and area you currently are to show relevant
        statistics. Although the GPS coordinates are sent to the server, they are
        only used to determine the country, region and area and are not stored.
        Neverheless, the GPS coordinate, when provided, will be rounder to only 
        two most semnificative digits to further protect your location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>IP Address</strong> - the IP Address is used to infer your broad location to the 
        level of country, region and area in the absence of GPS coordinates. 
        This is less accurate in detecting your current area, but it helps  
        selecting the right country. We do not store the IP Addresses in our 
        servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hospital Code</strong> - this is a code which is randomly genrated at the first
        run of the app. Like the DeviceId, it does not persist if the application
        is deleted and reinstalled. Moreover, it will be wipd and regnerated if
        the <strong>Reset application data</strong> option from <strong>More 
        Options</strong> is used.
        However, if provided by your doctor, it can be updated using the
        <strong>Change hospital code</strong> from <strong>More Options</strong> 
        screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Symptoms Results</strong> - the symptoms results are collected 
        and stored along with the <strong>Hospial code</strong> for grouping 
        purposes and are intended only for statistical reasons. The symptom 
        results are stored localy in the app and are not rretriebvable when 
        the <strong>Hospital Code</strong> is changed.
      </li>
    </ul>
