      This is a week-end project (actually several week-ends) I was working, 
      once the COVID-19 became a pandemic. 
    </p>
    <p>      
      It was designd to keep you infomed on the progress of the contagion 
      and also provide a way for you to keep track of the progress of the 
      symptoms, even them being mild or absent (asymptomatic case).
    </p>
    <p>
      The app focused on two main areas: symptoms progress tracking, and 
      regional and country level statistics .
    </p>
    
    <h3>Symptoms progress tracking</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Symptoms assessment can be done quickly, by pressing the Symptoms button. 
      Answer by pressing green, yellow or red on individual questions.</li>
    <li>If the app indentifies a change in symptoms, you will be asked to 
      complete a the Roth Test, which is an instrument to evaluate the 
      respiratory rate. </li>
    <li>A Roth Test score over 25 indicates a normal respiation rate.</li>
    <li>The complete history of the symptoms assessment results are accessible 
      once the Results screen and can be inspected anytime.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Contagion Statistics</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The app will use you location to retrieve the official statistics about
      the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </li>
    <li>Reported cases and Death cases are provided at country level.</li>
    <li>You can inspect the progress of the reported cases at local area level 
      for the past 30 days in a animated graph. </li>
    <li>You can change your current location, either local (in UK only) or 
      country-wise from the On Map screen, where you can pick the place of 
      interest.</li>
    <li>UK - The data is retrieved from GOV.UK official site (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk)</li>
    <li>WorldWide - The data is retrieved from COVID-19 Data Repository by the 
      Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins 
      University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Local Notifications</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The app will schedule daily local notifications as reminders to assess
      your symptoms and eventually take the Roth Test.</li>
    <li>the app will also send you prompts for symptoms assessments.</li>
    <li>Your are encouraged to act and confirm the actions required by the 
      reminders.</li>
    </ul>
